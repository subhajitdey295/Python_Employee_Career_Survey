# Employee_Career_Survey_Analysis_Using_Python


✔ Objective: The primary goal of this analysis is to explore the key factors influencing employee career aspirations, especially Gen Z, and to identify trends in education, work preferences, and retention rates using Python.

✔ Data Cleaning (Pandas and Numpy Library): Pandas was utilized for data manipulation, handling missing values, and structuring the dataset for effective analysis. NumPy was used for numerical computations, enabling efficient data processing and transformation.

✔ Data Analysis:
   ➡️ What is the analysis of the country?: Our analysis indicates that India has the highest number of employees, suggesting a potential need for further 
   segmentation based on specific regions within India for future analyses.

   ➡️ What is the preferred working environment of Genz?: The majority of employees prefer flexible work arrangements, with 25.5% favoring fully remote with travel options, 24.3% preferring a hybrid model (≤15 
   days in-office), and 21.3% opting for a daily office setup, while smaller groups prefer hybrid models with fewer in-office days or fully remote with no office access.
